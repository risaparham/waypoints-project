Come be a part of our community!</p> <p>NOTE: Due to the pandemic (the slow, creeping nightmare that has become our lives, not the award winning board game) we respectfully ask that attendees make sure to RSVP to Games With Strangers. If we do not have enough RSVPs to fill a game by noon on game day, that night's event will be cancelled, so sign up early and let's break some attendance records!</p> ",
