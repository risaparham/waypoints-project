    With Strangers. Grab a drink or dinner, meet some new people, and learn a new

    sure that things are running smoothly. Come be a part of our community!</p> <p>NOTE:
    Due to the pandemic (the slow, creeping nightmare that has become our lives, not
    the award winning board game) we respectfully ask that attendees make sure to
    RSVP to Games With Strangers. If we do not have enough RSVPs to fill a game by
    noon on game day, that night's event will be cancelled, so sign up early and let's
    break some attendance records!</p> "

    <p>Welcome to Switch &amp; Play NYC! Normally, we have our weekly Friday
    meetups at Rockefeller Concourse, playing Switch games together. However,
    we had to put in-person meetups on hold due to the current state of the
    COVID-19 Pandemic. Instead, we're doing online meetups on Discord, where
    we play games together online, and watch people play on a Discord Stream,
    while voice chatting! We play games such as:</p> <p>- Mario Kart 8
    Deluxe<br/>- Animal Crossing: New Horizons<br/>- Super Smash Bros.
    Ultimate<br/>- Spellbreak<br/>- Rivals of Aether<br/>- Jackbox Party
    Packs</p> <p>And many more!</p> <p>Plus non-Switch games such as:<br/>-
    Among Us<br/>- Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</p> <p>We hope that you are
    able to join us, as we look forward to having you with us!</p>

Otherwise masks up \U0001F637</p> <p>Since we are still in pandemicy times, I want to respect that others may not be as comfortable with big groups so for now events will be set to 10. I will still have online events.</p> <p>Guidelines and expectations:<br/>-Respect everyone<br/>-Come open minded<br/>-Must be 18+ years old<br/>-Harassment, discrimination, racist, and sexist actions/talk will not be tolerated and you will be promptly removed.<br/>-Respect all public areas/private store rules about masks.</p> "

    <p>Let's get together on Discord and play some Super Smash Bros Unlimited!
    Btw rsvp opens 1 week before the event.</p> <p>I am very not good at the
    game OTL Depending on how many people want to play- we can split up online
    in different rooms (by level) and switch around. We can play for fun or
    competitive. I always enjoy items, but I know there are some strong
    feelings about items haha</p> <p>Players of all levels are welcome, please
    be nice plzzzzzz~</p> <p>Guidelines and expectations still apply
    online:<br/>-Respect everyone<br/>-Come open minded<br/>-Must be 18+ years
    old<br/>-Harassment, discrimination, racist, and sexist actions/talk will
    not be tolerated and you will be promptly removed.<br/>-Please no explicit
    pictures (iykyk)<br/>-No spoilers on current seasons of anime. Anything
    over a year is fair game.</p> <p>I will send out the discord link day of
    vis the announcement feature of Meetup. Make sure to check your
    inbox/spam/notification setting if you are planning to attend. No worries
    if plans change. If you still do not see the link and would like to attend
    please DM me day of. Love meeting new people!!</p>

    <p>Let's play a game on Bridge Base Online (BBO) for a team game. Limited
    to 8 players. As usual, all our games are free.</p> <p>In order to play
    you must set up a Bridge Base Online account (www.bridgebase.com) and
    create a user name. Once that is done, you can email me your user name
    ([masked]) and I will set up the game.</p> <p>Log into BBO 10-15 minutes
    before the game starts. I will put the tables together before the game
    starts, using our players who have RSVPed and have logged into BBO. If you
    have a partner, let me know and I'll seat you together.</p> <p>Remember,
    you need to know how to play the game before you RSVP and you need to
    provide me with your name and your BBO user name in advance and be logged
    in. You cannot come late. (If you RSVP that you will attend and then don't
    show up, you risk not being invited again.)</p> <p>For your assistance,
    here is a BBO website overview, watch Silvana's video, from the Sagamore
    Bridge Club. Go to: http://sagamorebridgeclub.com/, wait a few seconds for
    the page to load completely, then click on the purple box that says
    Tutorial to play online.</p> <p>Zoom Meeting ID:[masked]<br/>Password:

    <p>NEW CAMPAIGN, Session One, players participated in a session zero last
    week. Please review the tech requirements below (audio, laptop/desktop,
    discord or zoom access). Each session requires payment per our Club
    policy. Beginners welcome and encouraged!</p> <p>Campaign Overview:</p>
    <p>Candlekeep attracts scholars like a flame attracts moths. Historians,
    sages, and others who crave knowledge flock to this library fortress to
    peruse its vast collection of books, scribbled into which are the answers
    to the mysteries that bedevil them. Many of these books contain their own
    mysteries ̶—each one a doorway to adventure. Dare you cross that
    threshold?</p> <p>This campaign will consist of loosely related one-shot
    adventures in the theme of the publish materials.</p> <p>About the
    DM:<br/>Hosted by Cole.<br/>Bio:<br/>I am a long time player and Dungeon
    Master who loves D&amp;d and art. I am open to all sorts of campaigns
    including one shots and longer modules.</p> <p>Discord link:</p>
    <p>https://discord.gg/xgCCa42></p> <p>Pregenerated Characters found
    here>https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/trpg-resources/trpg-resource></p>
    <p>DM will provide link to virtual tabletop upon sign up.</p> <p>DM will
    provide link to private discord or zoom platform (for video/audio) upon
    sign up.</p> <p>Who will enjoy this campaign?<br/>1) Players brand new to
    table top roleplaying! This is a great 'getting started' adventure.<br/>2)
    Players who want to explore a Gothic world filled with horror and
    intrigue; you are free to roam the land of Barovia without time pressures
    or a straight line plot (railroad) forcing you along.<br/>3) Players
    looking for a balance of social, exploration, and combat gameplay.</p>
    <p>What if you've never played an RPG, what is it like?</p> <p>Our games
    are player driven, putting you and your character at the center of the
    plot. Your choices will decide the outcome: from hard fought victory to an
    untimely end. We're here to tell a great story that makes you feel like
    you're in your favorite book or movie.</p> <p>Event policies</p>
    <p>Tickets:<br/>Players are required to purchase seat tickets for each
    session. This ensures reliable participation by the members, and thorough
    preparation and follow through by the DMs. This allows us to compensate
    DMs for events to ensure a positive experience from beginning to end.</p>
    <p>In reserving your seat you are committing to the DM and fellow players
    that you will attend, as preparation is based on number of players.
    Therefore, ticket sales are final, no exceptions. Please do not 'drop in'
    to or 'zoom bomb' the event.</p> <p>Open tables:<br/>D&amp;D is an awesome
    experience, and our tables are open to all players. We'll teach you
    everything you need to know, and everybody we play with is very welcoming
    to players interested in checking out the hobby.</p>

  description: "<p>Hello!<br/>Let's hangout and drink some bubble tea/ coffee (as long as we have good weather!) I will try to think of different parks and outdoor places we can meet up at so it's not just the same park! Location TBD</p> <p>It's weird times to put this in a meet up message but here goes:<br/>If you have been fully vaccinated and or will be fully vaccinated by this time, please be prepared to show proof (picture of the CDC card is fine). Otherwise masks up \U0001F637</p> <p>Since we are still in pandemicy times, I want to respect that others may not be as comfortable with big groups so for now events will be set to 12. There will still be online events throughout summer.</p> <p>I know waitlist can be a bummer and public space is public space (iykyk) so take that as you want. I do ask that anyone who is signing up to have an honor code and either come through or switch themselves to Not Going so that anyone who is on the waitlist has a chance to join. I will respond to any inquiries via DM.</p> <p>Guidelines and expectations:<br/>-Respect everyone<br/>-Come open minded<br/>-Must be 18+ years old<br/>-Harassment, discrimination, racist, and sexist actions/talk will not be tolerated and you will be promptly removed.<br/>-Respect all public areas/private store rules about masks.</p> "
